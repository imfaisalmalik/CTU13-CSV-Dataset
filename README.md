# CTU13-CSV-Dataset

This Dataset is generated by processing the Pcap files of [CTU-13 Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13) using [CICFlowMeter Tool](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter.git).

In order to create this CSV dataset:
1. We imported all Pcap files of [CTU-13 Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13) using [CICFlowMeter Tool](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter.git).
2. The [CICFlowMeter Tool](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter.git) converts the given Pcap Files into CSV Files based on Packet Flows.
3. We then merged all attack traffic samples into `CTU13_Attack_Traffic.csv` based on Attack IPs.
4. Similarly, we merged all normal traffic samples into `CTU13_Normal_Traffic.csv` by considering all IPS other than Attack IPs.

In short, You see 2 CSV Files in this repo:
- `CTU13_Attack_Traffic.csv` contains Botnet attack traffic samples.
- `CTU13_Normal_Traffic.csv` contains Normal traffic samples.

*The CTU-13 Dataset is a Labeled Dataset with Botnet, Normal and Background traffic*

- The CTU-13 is a dataset of botnet traffic that was captured in the CTU University, Czech Republic, in 2011. 
- The goal of the dataset was to have a large capture of real botnet traffic mixed with normal traffic and background traffic. 
- The CTU-13 dataset consists in thirteen captures (called scenarios) of different botnet samples. On each scenario we executed a specific malware, which used several protocols and performed different actions.
